## 📡 What Is the Enemy Radar Hack?

The **enemy radar** is a cheat overlay that mimics an in-game minimap — but with way more power. It scans your surroundings and reveals:

* 👤 Player positions (enemies, allies, neutrals)
* 🐲 Mobs and monsters, with level and rarity
* 🛡️ Bosses, elites, and world event enemies
* 💥 Attack range indicators (for safer approach)
* ⚠️ Gank groups or zerg detection zones

It’s like having UAV in an MMO. Every movement around you becomes visible, even through terrain or fog-of-war. And it updates in real-time, so you’re *always* one step ahead.
